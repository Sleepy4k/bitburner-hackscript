# BitBurner Scripts

A collection of scripts that I use for the game [BitBurner](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner)

Note: I don't promise that these scripts are fully optimized.

## Usage and Help

If you want to use these scripts, feel free!

If you have find an issue with one of the scripts, please open an issue

## Note

Choose version of script higher the number mean its more optimized and automated or maybe bug fixed or little adjustment

If you already choose your version then unpack it on your home server, after that you can execute init file
